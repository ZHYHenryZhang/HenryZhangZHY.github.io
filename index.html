<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a M.S. Student at 
  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
  University of California, San Diego, 
  with a specialization in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control.
  I graduated from Nanjing University in 2018.

<p>
  I am interested in Robotics Applications, hoping that they can reduce laborious work and increase human living quality. 
  Autonomous Vehicles is one of the perfect applications. 
  These tasks are often hard to tackle. The harder problem is what it really means by a better quality life. 
  I hope more people can join the journey to conquer these problems.

  I like <a href="https://henryzhangzhy.github.io/2019/08/12/invitation-to-pick-up-soccer.html">playing soccer</a>. 
  I enjoy the feeling of focusing on the soccer, chasing on the pitch, and forgetting everything else in the world for two hours.
