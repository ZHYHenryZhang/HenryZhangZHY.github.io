<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a M.S. Student at 
  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
  University of California, San Diego, 
  with a specialization in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control.
  I graduated from Nanjing University in 2018.
</p>

<p>
  I am interested in Robotics Applications. 
  And found that Autonomous Vehicles is a perfect application that is both attractive to me and helpful to others.
  It is not easy, I hope more people can work on it together to conquer this problem.
