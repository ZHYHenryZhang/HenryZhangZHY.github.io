Henry knows about the listed subject at most as much as it is writen in the corresponding post.

There are so many interesting things around. Without an efficient organization and compression method, I cannot recall them, not to mention applying them in work. I would admit that from the dozens of courses that I had taken, I don't really remember them. It is a painful truth and my solution right now is to write posts about them. This is a process of recall and organizing them. For the content not presented, they should be assumed unknown, that's why those posts would be named knowledge upper bound.

I should admit that I don't have a good memory, or maybe in some aspects.

For the famous novels that I had read in my childhood. I cannot remember the characters's names, or the plot.

And I should also admit that I had a broad interests.

I learned HTML, CSS becuase I want to try to make a website. I learned AE, PR to make videos. I learned VBA cause I wanted to extract new vocabulary from text to excel.

And a lot of tools picked up in class are forgotten after not being used when classes finished. assembly language programming in RISC and CISC architecture. MATLAB for image processing, statistical learning and control theory. Pytorch for deep learning.

Learning in class without sufficient projects or other methods to output knowledge is a disaster. Short-term memory lost after reboot and long-term memory being overwritten. What a waste of time and effort!
