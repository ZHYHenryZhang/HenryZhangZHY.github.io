Soccer training methods collection.

I want to write about this becuase I was amazed by a video shared by Tay, that there are so many good training methods I have never heard about.

Soccer is a game of two teams, where each has 11 players. There are many levels of skills, personal level, group level, or team level. I will use this post as a collection of training methods.

## Trainings

### Single Person

Most of the time, you are passing the ball around with your teammates. If not, your team is in trouble. It is vital that you can pass accurately with proper speed. And most importantly, practice your first touch so that the entire process is fast.

#### No equipment

1. pull outside to inside [using one foot or both feet]
2. side drag back and forth [buttom of the shoes]
3. behind the leg V-cut [one foot step forward, another feet drag the ball and to v-cut behind]
4. every touch dribble [dribble every touch, accelerate, lower your center of gravity]

#### cone
1. cone weave ( one step for each)
   - outside right, inside left
   - drag (one drag, one touch stop, drag again)
   - la croqueta
2. mine field (scatter cones randomly)
3. cone weave progression (three steps apart)
4. steps practice using cones
   - left right
   - jump
   - double step

#### wall
1. toe touch to pass [use toe to stop the ball and pass]
2. pass to la croqueta [use one foot to bring the ball to another feet and control it]
3. two touch pass [pass the ball to the wall and stop it then pass again.]

### Two people

1. numbered touch \[A call out a number k when passing to B, B must return the ball with k touch, usually k=1,2,3\]\[variation: A throw the ball to B\] 
2. color direction \[A and B pass to each other until A call a color, B must take his first touch toward the direction of that gate\]\[require: six cones set up to the left, right and back of B, with three different color.\]\[shake the head to observe the color\]\[variation 1: A throw the ball to B\]\[variation 2: B use chest for first touch\]
3. back direction \[A pass against the wall, until B point his leg to left, right, top, A need to control the ball to left, right and back.\][\require: wall, for cones\]
4. ball guns \[ A dribble towards B, B shoots balls towards A, A need to avoid them\]\[require: balls\]
5. two touches mimic \[mimic what another player is doing after he did it, shoot against the wall to let the ball go through the cones]
6. through the cones \[ A and B pass between the square cones, only go straight, and two touches.\]\[require: four cones\]
