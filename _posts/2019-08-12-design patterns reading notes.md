Notes about Design Patterns.

I was amazed by some of the ideas from this book. So I decided to start a post about this book. Just for some random remarks, for this 'remarkable' book.

1. > We don't do a good job recording experience in software engineering for others to use.

   While human beings are documenting their experience using books, videos, and comments. It is true that we are far from efficiently recording our experience and share the useful things with those who might need it. Put it another way, we are using an inefficient algorithm to evolve.

2. > It's important to understand the difference between an object's class and its type. An object's class defines how the object is implemented. The class defines the object's internal state and the implementation of its operations. In contrast, an object's type only refers to its interface--the set of requrests to which it can respond. An object can have many types, and objects of different classes can have the same type.

   I have never thought about it before. Class defines the implementation while type only refers to the interface. The reason probably because we often only use class inheritance in C++.
